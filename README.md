Shell Scripting for DevOps 🚀

This repository contains shell scripts and notes to learn Shell Scripting from Basic to Advanced, tailored for DevOps use cases.

Shell scripting is a powerful skill for automation in Linux, cloud, and DevOps environments. It is used to automate deployments, monitor systems, manage servers, and integrate with DevOps tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud CLIs.

📌 Concepts Covered

🔰 Basics

In DevOps, we often use variables to store values and command-line arguments ($0, $1, $#) to make scripts dynamic. The read command helps accept user input.
Conditional statements (if-else) are used to make decisions, and loops (for, while) help run repetitive tasks like checking multiple servers. The case statement is useful for handling multiple options such as service management (start, stop, status).

⚙️ Intermediate

We use functions to organize code into reusable blocks. Exit status ($?) is important to check whether a command ran successfully. File test operators (-f, -d, -r) ensure files or directories exist before taking action.
Redirection (>, >>, 2>) and piping (|) are heavily used for handling logs and command outputs. Cron jobs are widely used to schedule tasks like backups, cleanup jobs, or monitoring checks. Debugging scripts with bash -x helps fix issues quickly.

🚀 Advanced (DevOps-Oriented)

In real DevOps work, shell scripts are used to:

Monitor system health (CPU, memory, disk usage).

Analyze logs and detect errors automatically.

Manage services by starting, stopping, or restarting them.

Automate user management (create/delete users, assign groups).

Check server/network status (ping multiple servers, check port availability).

Integrate with cloud and DevOps tools like AWS CLI, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Support CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins for build and deployment automation.

Use grep, awk, sed for text/log processing.

Handle errors with trap and run commands in parallel with background processes (&, wait).
